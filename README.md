This project is based on a previous project that I made for Android called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ardondev.keylocker">KeyLocker</a>.

In my path to learn Swift and iOS development, I decided to make this app from scratch for this platform, applying all the knowledges I know until now.

Actually this is a basic app, just works to create a kind of KEY, where you store your account credentials like user or email, password, and some customization as put an alias or choose an icon.

Maybe the interesting features are the <b>Authentication for unlock</b>:

And the <b>Update History</b> where every change in your account's password will be stored like a Record:

Actually I had this app idea because I use some apps where is a requirement to sometime update your password. Also to recover some accounts the website ask you some old passwords to probe that it's you, so I think is useful for this scenarios.
